                        <p>The Akan Name Generator is a unique tool inspired by the rich culture and traditions of the
                            Akan
                            people
                            in
                            Ghana. Akan names are not randomly assigned; instead, they hold significant meaning and
                            symbolism.

                        <p>
                            Birth Details: Users input their date of birth into the generator.
                            Day Names: In Ghanaian culture, children are often given their first name as a ‚Äúday name‚Äù,
                            corresponding
                            to
                            the day of the week they were born. The Akan naming system is based on this tradition.
                            Gender-Specific Names: Depending on the user‚Äôs gender, the generator outputs an appropriate
                            Akan
                            name.
